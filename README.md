# Now it is a working local webpage if you run it through the Visual Studios Node.js functionality.
# If you run it, it will open up a webpage that has some text to make sure it loads.
# Use Advanced REST Client to send a put request to http://localhost:1337 and it will just respond with the body json object string flipped
  For an example string you could use ["string to be flipped"] in the json body of the request.
# It also prints the string you sent in the body before and after getting flipped in the console
  I also have an extra get endpoint because by default VS sends a get request to the server and opens up a page but It is not necassary, I just think it makes it look nicer.
